# bis-finder

Sort out trash from boxes with Annihilation/Dark Light gear. 

When you have many gear boxes, it's so pain to check stats when opening them. This mod will notify you once BIS gear is opened. 
BIS is a 3-stats gear, Hand Armor with 0.04 or 0.03 physical or magical crit stats, and Body Armor or Feet Armor with three physical or magical burst stats: physical for Annihilation gear, and magical for Dark Light gear.

How to use

- Clean up your inventory (pocket is not used) 
- BIS finder is turned off by default, so you have to write /8 bis in chat before you start
- Now start opening boxes into your inventory. BIS will notify you once you get something valuable and tell you the slot where the BIS located. 
- You can store actual BIS piece and sell the rest to broker or merchant to repeat the process.
